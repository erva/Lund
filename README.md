Simple everyday tool to show current bank balance from sms and notifications in widget.

* Supports Pumb, Private bank, UkrSib, Aval, Monobank
* Easy to extend with any other bank (sms or notification)
* No analytics, network permission, etc.
* Lightweight as possible 

It was named Lund because the idea of the widget came up when I was in Lund (Sweden) and used only a bank card.
